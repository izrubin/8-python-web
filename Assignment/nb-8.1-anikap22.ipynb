    "# Notebook 8.1 RESTful GBIF\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce you to methods for parsing data from the web by accessing websites that have RESTful APIs. In the next notebook we will continue to other methods for parsing data from the web as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "These notebook will involve two core aspects: (1) Working with RESTful APIs, which we discussed briefly in lecture; and (2) Parsing HTML text. The first is much easier since the data that we query from the web is returned in a form that is easy to interpret and *meant* to be parsed and analyzed, whereas the second way requires us to learn a little about how the internet works, which is also useful stuff to know. So let's get started. You'll need to install the two libraries below. "

    "### The design of REST APIs. \n",
    "The idea behind REST APIs is that data on a server (like a webpage) can be accessed with a consistent type of argument in the form of a URL, to query data which will then be returned in a form that is easy to analyze (usually json or xml), as opposed to being returned in messy HTML that needs to be parsed. Many websites have REST APIs, but some are much easier to use than others. "

    "### Limits\n",
    "Many REST APIs have limits on the way that you can use them. For example, the REST APIs for Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit require that you login in order to access data, and some sites will throttle how many requests you can make per hour. Although usually sites with a REST API are intended to be searched, the tools we will learn here can be used to search almost any website. It is important to know that some sites will intentionally block you if you try too aggressively to scrape data from them. For example, google scholar and genbank both have limits on the number of queries you can make per hour. "

    "### Good REST APIs\n",
    "A good REST API will have good directions for its usage. Two very good examples are the [USDA Bison API](https://bison.usgs.gov/#api) and the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary). We'll focus on the latter in this notebook. The GBIF database is an international effort to collect all observation data on plants, animals, and fungi into a single place where it can be searched. It is actually a conglomeration of many separate databases, with data from museums and similar institutions all over the world. These APIs are free to use but request that you cite them if the data is used in a publication eventually. "

    "### What does GBIF do?\n",
    "GBIF can be used to find specimen collection records, or other types of observation data, stored in museum type databases. The website offers a convenient way to request taxa by name, and to select specific research criteria. For example, if we wanted to find all specimens of bumblebees (genus *Bombus*) that were collected between 1910 and 1920 we could request this through the website. It will draw a nice map with their locations and you can download a table with coordinates of where they were collected. This is actually one of the best databases around, since it organizes the data quite easily for you to download, but nevertheless, we'll use it as our example to learn REST APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though GBIF has a very nice web interface, it is obviously often more efficient to be able to query this database programmatically, instead of having to type each name we wish to search, and click on several buttons. This can provide a much more powerful way of applying filters over many different types of searches. That is the idea behind REST APIs and the reason why GBIF provides one. "

For GBIF this is the following, which we'll store as a string for now. This base-url address is given to us right at the top of the [GBIF API documentation](https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence). You can see that it looks much like any other web address. "

We've added just the 'query' option 'q' and the name. We'll see next how to make more complex queries. But first, copy the URL below (without the quotation marks around it) and paste it into a web browser. This will show you what the returned data looks like. It might look a bit different depending on which browser you are using (I recommend using firefox or chrome) but the underlying data is the same, and is called JSON data."

These are explained in the API docs, and correspond to information about what records are available for our query. However, it did not return *all* of the data for those records to us yet. That would be too easy. Instead, databases usually have limits on the amount of data from each request as a way of limiting the bandwidth they will need for sending the data, and to make it faster. For GBIF the default number, shown under the \"limit\" key, is 20. And the default starting position, shown under \"offset\" is 0. The total number of records is in \"count\". So for *Bombus*, as we show below, there are 1,048,303 records, but on records 1-20 were returned to us so far."

    "Here we add more arguments to further filter the results. To see which options are available, you can either look at the results from our existing calls so far, or you can read further into the API docs. Sometimes API docs will be incomplete though, so it can be useful to learn to try to infer which options are possible from looking at the results. A more complex search is accomplished by building a URL that has more key:value pairs each appended to the end of the URL, and separated by a \"&\" symbol. For large searches it begins to get difficult to write out by hand, and that is where `requests` comes in handy. Here we enter the additional arguments we want using a simple python dictionary into the entry 'params'. Below I show the URL for when we add the requirement that a record have coordinate data, and for when we add additional arguments to raise the limit for the number of records returned. The max records at a time (limit - offset) is 300. Above that you need to increment the offset to search higher values."

    "Once you have tested your Record class object in this notebook and it is working, copy it to a new `.py` file in a text editor and name it records.py, and put this in a new folder called `records/`. Then add an `__init__.py` file and a `setup.py` file and structure this directory so that it can be imported as a Python package. If you need a review on how to do this look back at lecture 5, and the assignment from that lecture (https://github.com/programming-for-bio/5-Packaging/blob/master/Notebooks/nb-5.2-packaging.ipynb). This will be very similar to the 'helloworld' package that we wrote. When you are finished, install the package with pip and try importing it like below. Then push the `records` folder as a new repo to your GitHub account named records.  "

Then push your updated/fixed code to GitHub before the next class. You should hopefully be able to get it working, since you've done all of these tasks before. We are going to continue adding new functions to this library over the next two weeks, so if you get stuck on this assignment ask for help and try to keep up, because it will be very difficult if you get behind.
