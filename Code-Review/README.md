# Code Review 8 

For code-review assignment 8 you will review and revise your own code
by comparing it to versions of the same code in the course `records` 
repository. Then update your repository to match. There are currently two 
versions of the `records` code on the course repo in two separate branches. 
You can switch between them by clicking on the `Branch:master` button on the 
GitHub page, or by following the links below.


1. Review code in the [assignment branch](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/records/tree/assignment) and compare your code with it. You do not yet have to update your
code at this stage. 

2. Read the [code-review notebook in the master branch](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/records/blob/master/notebooks/records-class-objects.ipynb) to learn about 
further changes to the `records` code, a for an explanation of each.

3. Finally, following along with the notebook above, and by looking at the code 
in the [master branch](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/records/tree/master) 
update your `records` repository to match the master branch (v.0.2).
